# DVD_Logo_Animation
The classic DVD Logo idle screen from years past now on your very own computer!

To use this program, you will need:
- Pillow (installed in terminal with "pip install pillow")
- *Optional: Screeninfo (This is for if you want to have the logo move through multiple monintors
***ONLY WORKS PROPERLY IF MONITORS ARE ALL IN A LINE, IE ON THE SAME Y AXIS*** Otherwise the logo will seem to jump oddly between screens.
The code for this is commented out, but it can be used by uncommenting lines 36 through 40. To install screen info, in terminal use "pip install screeninfo".

Thanks for looking and I hope you like it!
